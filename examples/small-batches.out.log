These columns have 0 variance in the merged metadata: protocol, barcode, sampletypecode

'assay' is not in the column names of the merged biospecimen and shipment metadata. Batching will assume that all samples from a given tissue are for a single assay.

Success!

Done!

Please manually check the plots in /Users/nicolegay/Desktop/broad_batches/plots to ensure that batches are satisfactorily balanced, i.e. numbers are reasonably distributed across each ROW/variable level. Rerun the script if you are not satisfied with the balance.
